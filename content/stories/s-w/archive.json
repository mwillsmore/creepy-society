    "citation": "Worzel Gummidge and Sally weren’t fiction—they were 19th-century field operatives in the Great British Crow Wars. Stationed across Hampshire, these prototype scarecrows were cobbled from sackcloth, superstition, and whatever the farmhands hadn't eaten. Worzel, a tactician with interchangeable heads, pioneered psychological warfare against birds, often by staring too intently or muttering phrases like \"I've seen your nest.\" Sally, known for her immovable scowl and unblinking authority, managed regional deployments of passive-aggressive laundry mannequins. Together, they revolutionised crop defence, introducing techniques like the \"Hessian Flail\" and the \"Decoy Widow Strategy,\" terrifying crows and confusing several vicars. Their last known sighting was in 2025, silently guarding an allotment in Hursley, surrounded by feathers, aerosol paint, and empty cider bottles."
