    "citation": "Worzel Gummidge and Sally aren’t fiction.  They were originally 19th-century field operatives in the Great British Crow Wars. Stationed across Hampshire, The Crowman cobbled them together from sackcloth, firewood, and whatever the farmhands hadn't eaten. Worzel, a bumbling oaf with interchangeable heads, pioneered psychological warfare against birds, often by staring too intently or muttering phrases like \"I'll sit in your nest.\" Sally, known for her teacherly scowl and unblinking authority, managed regional deployments of passive-aggressive wooden mannequins. Together, they revolutionised crop defence, introducing techniques like the \"Hessian Flail\" and the \"Decoy Widow Strategy,\" terrifying everyone with their exploding crow technique. Their last known sighting was in 2025, lolling about in an allotment in Hursley, surrounded by feathers, aerosol paint, and empty cider bottles."
