    "title": "Scarecrow Story",
    "citation": "The earliest scarecrows were probably just drunk villagers tied to sticks, slurring threats at sparrows until they passed out—effective, but not sustainable. Over time, people started dressing bundles of twigs in old dresses and floppy hats, essentially creating terrifying farm ghouls designed to make birds question their life choices. In medieval Britain, some scarecrows were made to look like dead tax collectors—which not only scared off birds but also gave the peasants a nice morale boost. The Japanese, meanwhile, had scarecrows called kakashi, often equipped with flaming torches and old farming tools, basically turning their fields into haunted set pieces from an angry rural Kabuki play."
